# Level3TeamProject - PainTracker

PainTracker is a mobile (Android) application developed in collaboration with Pain Association Scotland.
The goal of the app is to provide people suffering from chronic pain with a portable and easy to use tool to help monitor and record their pain attacks
as well as to give access to resources and advice on how to deal with chronic pain.

## Features

1) Spider questionnaire and diagram that measures and illustrates the user's overall ability to cope with chronic pain, providing the user with valueable feedback.
2) Videos that provide explanation and guidance on understanding pain, coping with pain attacks and learning different relaxation techniques.
3) Pain diary that allows the user to create and manage a database of detailed records of experienced pain attacks and incidents.
4) Ability to export stored records as an ordered PDF file to be shared with a doctor.
