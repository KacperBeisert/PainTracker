# PAS Pain Tracker
PAS Pain Tracker is a mobile app for Android developed in collaboration with Pain Association Scotland.
The goal of the app is to provide people suffering from chronic pain with a portable and easy to use tool to help monitor and record their pain attacks
as well as to give access to resources and advice on how to deal with chronic pain.

## Features
1) PAS Spider questionnaire and diagram that measures and illustrates the user's overall ability to cope with chronic pain, providing the user with valueable feedback.
2) PAS Videos that provide explanation and guidance on understanding pain, coping with pain attacks and learning different relaxation techniques.
3) PAS Pain Diary that allows the user to create and manage a database of detailed records of experienced pain attacks and incidents.
4) Ability to export stored records as an ordered PDF file to be shared with a doctor.

## Testing
The app comes with a set of instrumented and unit tests to help developers check and maintain the validity of app's inputs, outputs and methods.  
These tests can be accessed and executed with Android Studio IDE.  
The app also includes code style tests to ensure the proper structure and quality of code.  
A link to the guide to executing code style tests is available in the 'Coding style' section of this document.
